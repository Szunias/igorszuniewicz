### 5. **Challenges & Solutions — All Projects**

#### **Not Today Darling** (3 challenges added):
1. **4-Player Mix Clarity**
   - Problem: Frequency masking with 4 simultaneous players
   - Solution: Priority-based concurrency, per-slot EQ, sidechain ducking

2. **Surface Transition Pops**
   - Problem: Audible pops when switching track materials
   - Solution: Crossfade system with equal-power curve, cooldown timers

3. **Boost Sound Memory Spikes**
   - Problem: 40MB memory spikes per player
   - Solution: Refactored to procedural MetaSounds (reduced to <2MB)

#### **Amorak** (3 challenges added):
1. **Creature Low-End Without Muddiness**
   - Solution: Frequency carving (60-90Hz env, 120-180Hz creature), M/S processing

2. **Spatial Realism with Camera Cuts**
   - Solution: Proximity-adaptive layering system with 3 ambience layers

3. **Dialogue Clarity in Dense Soundscape**
   - Solution: Dynamic ducking, 1-3kHz notch, spectral shaping

#### **AudioLab** (3 challenges added):
1. **Achieving <50ms End-to-End Latency**
   - Solution: Optimized FFT, circular buffer, lightweight SVM classifier

2. **Beatbox Sound Similarity**
   - Solution: Enhanced feature set (spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, envelope analysis)

3. **Real-time Performance Without Audio Dropouts**
   - Solution: Decoupled threads, lock-free ringbuffer, graceful degradation

**Impact**: Shows problem-solving skills, technical depth, and real-world development experience.

## 🔄 IMPROVED TERMINOLOGY

**Upgraded descriptions with professional game audio language:**
- ❌ "Sound effects" → ✅ "SFX system with RTPC-driven parameters"
- ❌ "Music that changes" → ✅ "State-based adaptive music with vertical layering"
- ❌ "Better mixing" → ✅ "HDR mixing with priority-based ducking"
- ❌ "Distance effects" → ✅ "Attenuation curves with occlusion/obstruction"

---

## 📝 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (User Actions)

### 🔴 **CRITICAL — Must Do**
1. **Create Demo Reel** (2-3 minutes)
   - Record screen capture from Unreal showing audio implementation
   - Showcase SFX design breakdown (layering, processing)
   - Demonstrate Wwise/MetaSounds workflow
   - Upload to YouTube/Vimeo

2. **Add Audio Samples**
   - Export isolated SFX from projects
   - Create before/after comparisons
   - Show layering breakdown
   - Host on SoundCloud or embed directly

### 🟡 **IMPORTANT — Should Do**
3. **Screenshot Middleware Work**
   - Wwise RTPC setups
   - MetaSounds patches
   - Unreal audio submix architecture
   - Attenuation curve graphs

4. **Add Process Documentation**
   - One complete case study showing full pipeline
   - Pre-production → Asset creation → Implementation → Polish

5. **Collaboration Examples**
   - Short anecdotes about working with designers/programmers
   - How you integrated feedback from playtests

### 🟢 **NICE-TO-HAVE — Consider**
6. **Technical Blog Posts**
   - "How I optimized voice counts in multiplayer games"
   - "Procedural audio with MetaSounds"
   - "ML audio classification pipeline"

7. **Behind-the-Scenes Videos**
   - Time-lapse of sound design session
