## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Assets

### Required Images
You'll need to add these to your project:

1. **Cover Image:**
   - Path: `assets/images/projects/shadow-frames-cover.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 1280x720px or 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Should showcase: Black-and-white aesthetic, 1960s pub atmosphere, or Polaroid camera theme
   - Fallback is currently set to generic project image

2. **Optional Screenshots/Gallery Images:**
   - In-game screenshots of the pub
   - Polaroid camera UI
   - Anomaly examples
   - Wwise integration screenshots
   - Place in: `assets/images/projects-shadowframes/`

3. **Optional Video:**
   - YouTube/Vimeo gameplay video showing audio in action
   - Commented out section in HTML ready to use
   - Just uncomment and add video ID

### Optional Audio Samples
If you have audio samples you'd like to feature:
- Add `.wav` or `.mp3` files to `assets/audio/tracks/`
- Update the placeholder references in the HTML
- The audio player component is already built into the page structure

## üìù Notes

### Video Section
The video showcase section is commented out in the HTML. To enable it:
1. Upload your Shadow Frames gameplay video to YouTube/Vimeo
2. Get the video ID
3. Uncomment lines in `projects/shadow-frames.html`
4. Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with actual ID

### Main Index Integration
I did **NOT** add Shadow Frames to the main `index.html` featured carousel because:
- The carousel structure would need careful review
- It may use different image dimensions
- You may want to feature other projects first
- This can be added manually if desired

### Color Scheme
The page uses a horror-appropriate monochrome theme:
- **Background:** Pure blacks (#0a0a0a, #000000)
- **Text:** Light grays (#e0e0e0, #cccccc)
- **Accents:** White with subtle opacity
- **Borders:** Very subtle white borders (0.05-0.15 opacity)
- Matches the game's black-and-white visual style

### Professional Details Highlighted
- Wwise 2024.1 + Unreal Engine 5.4.4
- HRTF spatial audio
- Reaper DAW workflow
- Professional plugin chain (Waves J37, PaulXStretch, Valhalla, Soundtoys)
- Performance optimization (<5% CPU)
- Accessibility options

   - Click through to `/projects/shadow-frames.html`
