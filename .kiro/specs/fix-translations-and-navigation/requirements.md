# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses two critical issues on the portfolio website:
1. Missing translations on project pages (musicforgames.html and others)
2. Navigation bug where clicking "back to projects" prevents further project navigation

## Glossary

- **Translation System**: The i18n (internationalization) system that provides content in English (EN), Polish (PL), and Dutch (NL) languages
- **Navigation System**: The smooth-navigation.js system that handles page transitions
- **Project Pages**: Individual HTML pages in the /projects/ directory showcasing portfolio work
- **Back Button**: The "‚Üê Back to Projects" link that returns users to the projects index page

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Translation Coverage

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to view all project content in my preferred language (EN/PL/NL), so that I can fully understand the project details regardless of which language I speak.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits musicforgames.html, THE Translation System SHALL display all text content in the selected language
2. WHEN a user switches languages on any project page, THE Translation System SHALL update all translatable elements including section headers, project descriptions, and feature descriptions
3. WHEN a user visits any project page, THE Translation System SHALL load the corresponding locale JSON file without errors
4. WHERE translation keys exist in the HTML, THE Translation System SHALL replace them with human-sounding, natural language text that does not sound AI-generated
5. WHEN reviewing Polish and Dutch translations, THE Content SHALL sound authentic and natural to native speakers

### Requirement 2: Fix Navigation Bug

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to navigate between projects smoothly without encountering broken states, so that I can explore the portfolio without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "back to projects" from any project page, THE Navigation System SHALL return to the projects index page
2. WHEN a user is on the projects index page after clicking "back to projects", THE Navigation System SHALL allow clicking on any project card
3. IF a user clicks on a project card, THEN THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to that project page without requiring a page refresh
4. WHEN investigating the navigation bug, THE System SHALL identify and fix any event listener conflicts or state management issues
5. WHEN a user navigates back and forth between projects and the index page multiple times, THE Navigation System SHALL maintain full functionality without degradation

### Requirement 3: Natural Language Quality

**User Story:** As a Polish or Dutch speaker, I want translations that sound human and natural, so that the content feels professionally written rather than machine-translated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Polish translations, THE Content SHALL use natural Polish idioms and sentence structures
2. WHEN reviewing Dutch translations, THE Content SHALL use natural Dutch idioms and sentence structures
3. WHERE technical terms exist, THE Translations SHALL use commonly accepted terminology in each language
4. WHEN describing creative work, THE Translations SHALL maintain the artistic and professional tone of the original English content
5. IF translations sound robotic or unnatural, THEN THE Content SHALL be rewritten to sound more human and conversational
