# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue of unnatural, AI-sounding translations in Polish (pl) and Dutch (nl) locales. The current translations are literal word-for-word conversions that lack contextual awareness and natural language flow. The goal is to revise all Polish and Dutch translations to sound human, natural, and contextually appropriate while maintaining technical accuracy and the original meaning.

## Glossary

- **Translation System**: The i18n (internationalization) JSON files located in the `/locales` directory that contain translations for English (en), Polish (pl), and Dutch (nl) languages
- **Locale File**: A JSON file containing key-value pairs where keys are translation identifiers and values are translated strings in a specific language
- **Natural Language Flow**: Translation that sounds like it was written by a native speaker, using idiomatic expressions and culturally appropriate phrasing
- **Contextual Translation**: Translation that considers the surrounding context, purpose, and audience rather than literal word-for-word conversion
- **Source Language**: English (en) - the original language from which translations are derived
