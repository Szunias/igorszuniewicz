# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the music.html page by adding complete multilingual translations and implementing a modern track information display system. Users will be able to view detailed track descriptions without interrupting playback, similar to industry-standard music streaming platforms like Spotify and Tidal.

## Glossary

- **Music_Player**: The audio playback system on music.html that plays tracks
- **Track_Info_Modal**: A non-intrusive overlay that displays track details
- **Translation_System**: The i18n system that provides content in English, Polish, and Dutch
- **Playlist_View**: The scrollable list of all available tracks
- **Active_Track**: The currently playing or selected track

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

3. THE Translation_System SHALL translate the following elements: page title, page description, playlist header, filter tags, and all UI labels
4. THE Translation_System SHALL persist the language selection across page navigation using localStorage
5. WHERE a translation key is missing, THE Translation_System SHALL display the English fallback text

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to view detailed information about each track, so that I can learn more about the composition without stopping playback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks an info icon on a track, THE Track_Info_Modal SHALL display the track description, tags, year, and duration

5. WHEN THE Track_Info_Modal opens, THE system SHALL trap focus within the modal until it closes

### Requirement 4
