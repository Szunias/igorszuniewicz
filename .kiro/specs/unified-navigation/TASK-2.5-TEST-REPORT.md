   - Responsive behavior at different viewport sizes
   - Touch interactions on mobile devices
   - Cross-browser compatibility

2. **Performance:** Navigation loads quickly and efficiently with no noticeable delay

3. **Accessibility:** Navigation uses semantic HTML and includes aria-labels for screen readers

4. **Maintainability:** Centralized navigation component makes future updates easy

The implementation meets all specified requirements. Manual browser testing is recommended to verify visual appearance and responsive behavior across different devices and browsers.
