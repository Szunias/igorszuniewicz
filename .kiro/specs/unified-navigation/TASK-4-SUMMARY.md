# Task 4: Migrate contact.html to Unified Navigation - COMPLETE ✓

## Summary
Successfully migrated contact.html to use the unified navigation component. All inline navigation styles have been removed, navigation.css is linked, and navigation.js is loaded properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added navigation.css Link (Subtask 4.1) ✓
- Added `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/navigation.css">` to the head section
- Placed after Font Awesome and before inline styles

### 2. Removed Inline Navigation Styles (Subtask 4.2) ✓
Removed the following CSS sections from the inline `<style>` block:
- `.header` styles (fixed positioning, backdrop blur, transitions)
- `.header.scrolled` styles
- `.nav` styles (flex layout)
- `.logo` styles
- `.nav-links` styles (desktop navigation)
- `.nav-links a` styles (hover and active states)
- `.lang-switcher` styles
- `.lang-btn` styles (hover and active states)
- Responsive media query for `.nav-links { display: none; }`

### 3. Verified No Hardcoded Navigation HTML (Subtask 4.3) ✓
- Confirmed no hardcoded `<header>` or `<nav>` elements in body
- Navigation will be injected by navigation.js component

### 4. Verified navigation.js Script (Subtask 4.4) ✓
- Confirmed `<script src="assets/js/components/navigation.js"></script>` is present
- Script loads before translations.js (correct order)

### 5. Testing (Subtask 4.5) ✓
Created comprehensive test suite:
- `test-contact-navigation.html` - Interactive browser-based tests
- `verify-contact-navigation.js` - Automated Node.js verification script
