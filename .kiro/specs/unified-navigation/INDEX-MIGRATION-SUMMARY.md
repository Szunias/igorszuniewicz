## Task 2: Migrate index.html to unified navigation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-10-25

## Subtasks Completed

### 2.1 Verify navigation.css link exists in head ✅

**Status:** VERIFIED - Already present

**Location:** Line 90 in index.html
```html
<!-- Shared Navigation Styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/navigation.css">
```

**Result:** Navigation CSS is properly linked in the `<head>` section.

---

### 2.2 Remove inline navigation styles from index.html ✅

**Status:** VERIFIED - Already clean

**Findings:**
- No inline navigation styles found in `<style>` blocks
- Comment at line 318 confirms: `/* Navigation styles moved to assets/css/navigation.css */`
- All navigation-related CSS (.header, .nav, .logo, .nav-links, .lang-switcher, .mobile-menu, etc.) has been externalized

**Result:** No inline navigation styles present. All styles are in `assets/css/navigation.css`.

---

### 2.3 Remove hardcoded navigation HTML from index.html ✅

**Status:** VERIFIED - Already clean

**Findings:**
- No hardcoded `<header>` element in body
- No hardcoded `<nav>` element for main navigation (only footer nav exists, which is correct)
- Comment at line 1261 confirms: `<!-- Navigation loaded by navigation.js -->`
- Body is clean and ready for component injection

**Result:** No hardcoded navigation HTML. Navigation will be injected by navigation.js component.

**Status:** VERIFIED - Already present

**Location:** Line 1868 in index.html (before `</body>`)
