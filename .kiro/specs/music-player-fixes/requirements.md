# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for fixing critical bugs in the music player on the music.html page. The player currently has several usability issues including inability to seek through tracks, inconsistent time display, visual glitches with the progress bar, and poor visibility of the progress indicator.

## Glossary

- **Music Player**: The audio playback interface displayed at the bottom of the music.html page
- **Progress Bar**: The horizontal bar showing playback progress with time indicators
- **Seek Functionality**: The ability to click or drag on the progress bar to jump to different positions in the track
- **Time Display**: The current time and total duration indicators shown on either side of the progress bar
- **Progress Fill**: The colored portion of the progress bar indicating how much of the track has played
- **Visual Glitch**: Unwanted flickering, jumping, or inconsistent rendering of UI elements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user listening to music, I want to click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that position in the track, so that I can quickly navigate to my favorite parts of a song.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on any position within the progress bar, THE Music Player SHALL update the audio playback position to match the clicked position within 100 milliseconds
2. WHEN the user clicks on the progress bar, THE Progress Fill SHALL immediately update to reflect the new position
3. WHEN the user clicks on the progress bar, THE Time Display SHALL immediately update to show the new current time
4. WHILE the audio is playing, THE Music Player SHALL continue playback from the new position after seeking
5. WHILE the audio is paused, THE Music Player SHALL remain paused after seeking but update the position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user listening to music, I want to drag the progress indicator to scrub through the track, so that I can precisely find specific moments in the audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses and holds the mouse button on the progress bar, THE Music Player SHALL enter drag mode
2. WHILE in drag mode and the user moves the mouse horizontally, THE Progress Fill SHALL update in real-time to follow the mouse position
3. WHILE in drag mode, THE Time Display SHALL update in real-time to show the time at the current mouse position
4. WHEN the user releases the mouse button, THE Music Player SHALL seek to the position where the mouse was released
5. WHILE dragging, THE Music Player SHALL temporarily pause time updates from the audio element to prevent visual conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user listening to music, I want to see the current playback time and total duration clearly displayed, so that I know how long the track is and how much time remains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a track is loaded, THE Music Player SHALL display the total duration in MM:SS format within 500 milliseconds
2. WHILE audio is playing, THE Time Display SHALL update the current time every 100 milliseconds with smooth transitions
3. WHEN the audio duration is not yet available, THE Music Player SHALL display "0:00" as a placeholder
4. THE Time Display SHALL use monospaced font rendering to prevent layout shifts during updates
5. WHEN seeking to a new position, THE Time Display SHALL immediately reflect the new time without delay

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing the music player, I want the progress bar to have clear visual boundaries and smooth animations, so that I can easily see the playback progress without distracting glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Progress Bar SHALL have a visible border or background that clearly defines its start and end points
2. THE Progress Fill SHALL animate smoothly without flickering or jumping during normal playback
3. WHEN the progress updates, THE Progress Fill SHALL use CSS transitions limited to 200 milliseconds maximum to prevent lag
4. THE Progress Fill SHALL have sufficient contrast against the background to be visible in all lighting conditions
5. WHILE hovering over the progress bar, THE Music Player SHALL display a visual indicator showing where clicking would seek to

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the progress bar, I want visual feedback when hovering and clicking, so that I understand the interface is responsive to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over the progress bar, THE Progress Bar SHALL display a hover state with increased brightness or a highlight effect
2. WHEN the user hovers over the progress bar, THE Music Player SHALL show a preview indicator at the hover position
3. WHILE hovering, THE Music Player SHALL display a tooltip showing the time at the hover position
4. WHEN the user clicks or drags, THE Progress Bar SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 50 milliseconds
5. THE Progress Fill handle SHALL be visible and increase in size when the progress bar is hovered

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with the music player open, I want the progress bar animations to be optimized and not cause performance issues, so that the page remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Progress Fill SHALL update using CSS transforms or width properties optimized for GPU acceleration
2. THE Music Player SHALL throttle progress updates to maximum 10 updates per second during normal playback
3. WHEN multiple animations are active, THE Music Player SHALL prioritize essential updates over decorative effects
4. THE Progress Bar SHALL not trigger layout recalculations during progress updates
5. WHILE playing audio, THE Music Player SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance for all visual updates
